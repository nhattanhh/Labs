New York, NY:  December 6, 2023
Bringing together authors from Uganda, Mexico, the Philippines, Nigeria, Bangladesh, South Africa and the United States, among others, this timely anthology gives voice to queer people facing a barrage of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and bigotry worldwide. From Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Act to Florida's Don't Say Gay law, governments everywhere have been drawing inspiration from each other as they target their own queer communities, all the while claiming that queerness is something foreign and invasive. The storytellers collected in this book come together to push back on those silencing efforts, insisting that their voices, at least, cannot be censored or erased.
