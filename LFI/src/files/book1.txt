In many ways, this anthology calls to mind John Pepper Clark’s poem titled “Casualties” published in 1970. The needless and senseless conflicts in Sudan have rendered all of us casualties. This project affords us the rare opportunity to metaphorically walk on the blood-soaked streets of Khartoum and the Darfur region to capture, prepare and present to our readers vivid episodes of the tragic violence, hostilities and unimaginable carnages that occur on daily basis across Sudan. 
A unique feature that makes Thorns, Tears & Treachery worthy of note is in the fact that the writing is purely Pan-African. The works give a true reflection of the reality on ground, and are lavishly garnished in the finest flavors of the Continent's artistic soul.
